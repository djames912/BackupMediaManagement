BackupMediaManagement
=====

Backup Media Management system.  This is a system that was originally written for
the Morinda company as a way to help manage the literally thousands of backup tapes
that they had accumulated over the years.  It was designed by the users who actually
used the system and it significantly reduced the work load for the staff who were
involved with managing those tapes.

This project is the open source version of that system.  Some of the same concepts
and database design are used in this system.  This project is a complete rebuild
of the code base from the ground up in an effort to modernize and standardize it.

The hope here is to make this project usable by entities outside the Morinda
environment.
